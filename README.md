Project title: Predict the heart attack disease for organization who in the form ,using machine learning algorithm rate of heaart attack disease will incrasing and decreasing manner.

project title: A who estimated 12 million death records.one of them half of the deatth result is found in us. the research scholar point out the most relevent qrisk factor of heart attack as a data science engineer predict the overall wrisk using machine learning algorithm called as logistic regression

Task 1: Import the liraries which required for the prediction

TASK 2: Import the dataset by using your work space.

Task 3: Use the appropiate argument of sk learn library to train,test and aplit the dataset

Task 4: Fit your values with arange function using feature scaling

Task5: Check your model accuracy and precision using confusion matrix

#Import libraries
# load dataset
# Import sklearn library
#Perform train and test 

# feature Scaling
# training logistic regression model
Conclusion: According to the model analysis the LogesticRegression Algorithm works successfully with 0.4 accuracy.

The accuracy shows that building the model is successful.
